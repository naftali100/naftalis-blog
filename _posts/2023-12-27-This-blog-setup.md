# How I have created this blog

## jekyll

The base system for the blogs is powered by Jekyll.

The actual template and theme is based on the [chirpy theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page/)

### Get started

1. Fork the chirpy repo.
2. Allow Github actions.
3. Turn on github pages.
4. Add custom domain to pages.
5. Add CNAME record in your DNS provider from the domain you set in the previous step to <yourusername>.github.io.
6. Commit changes.
7. Have fun :).
